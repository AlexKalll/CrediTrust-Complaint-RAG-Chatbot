## üìã What Is This Project?

**CrediTrust Complaint RAG Chatbot** is an intelligent AI-powered system designed to help financial services companies analyze and respond to customer complaints more efficiently. The system uses advanced artificial intelligence to understand customer feedback, identify patterns, and provide actionable insights from thousands of complaint narratives.

Think of it as a **smart assistant for customer service teams** that can:
- Instantly search through thousands of customer complaints
- Answer questions about common issues, trends, and patterns
- Generate insights to help improve products and services
- Visualize complaint data through interactive dashboards

---

## ü§î What Problem Does It Solve?

**The Challenge:**
Financial institutions receive thousands of customer complaints every month. Manually reading, categorizing, and analyzing these complaints is:
- **Time-consuming**: Takes days or weeks to process
- **Inefficient**: Hard to find patterns across large datasets
- **Error-prone**: Important insights can be missed
- **Expensive**: Requires significant human resources

**The Solution:**
This RAG chatbot automates complaint analysis by:
- Processing complaints in seconds instead of days
- Finding relevant information instantly through semantic search
- Generating insights automatically using AI
- Providing interactive visualizations for data exploration

## üîç What is RAG? (In Simple Terms)

**RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** is a cutting-edge AI technique that combines two powerful capabilities:

1. **Retrieval**: The system searches through a database of customer complaints to find the most relevant information related to your question
2. **Generation**: An AI language model then uses this retrieved information to generate a comprehensive, accurate answer

**Why RAG is Better:**
- ‚úÖ Provides accurate, fact-based answers (not just generic responses)
- ‚úÖ Can cite specific complaints as sources
- ‚úÖ Learns from your actual data, not just general knowledge
- ‚úÖ Reduces "hallucinations" (made-up information) common in AI systems

**Example:**
If you ask: *"What are the common issues with credit cards?"*

The system will:
1. Search through actual complaint data to find credit card-related complaints
2. Analyze the patterns (e.g., "billing errors", "hidden fees", "poor customer service")
3. Generate a response citing specific examples from real complaints
4. Show you the source complaints so you can verify the information

## üìä How It Works (Technical Overview)

### **Step 1: Data Preparation**
1. Load customer complaint data from CSV files
2. Clean and preprocess text (remove noise, standardize format)
3. Extract relevant metadata (product type, issue category, complaint ID)

### **Step 2: Text Chunking**
1. Split large complaint narratives into smaller, manageable chunks
2. Ensure chunks overlap to preserve context
3. Store metadata for each chunk

### **Step 3: Embedding Generation**
1. Convert each text chunk into a numerical vector (embedding)
2. Use pre-trained transformer models to capture semantic meaning
3. Store embeddings in a searchable format

### **Step 4: Indexing**
1. Create a FAISS vector index for fast similarity search
2. Link embeddings to their original text chunks and metadata
3. Optimize for quick retrieval (milliseconds)

### **Step 5: Query Processing**
1. User asks a question in natural language
2. Convert the question into an embedding
3. Search the index for similar complaint chunks
4. Retrieve top-k most relevant complaints

### **Step 6: Response Generation**
1. Combine retrieved complaints into context
2. Use language model to generate comprehensive answer
3. Cite specific sources (complaints) used
4. Present results in user-friendly format
