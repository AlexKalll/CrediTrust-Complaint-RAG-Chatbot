## ðŸ”§ Technical Fixes Applied

### Import and Dependency Issues
```python
# Fixed missing imports
from pathlib import Path  # Added to data_preprocessing.py
langchain-community      # Added to requirements.txt
streamlit               # Added to requirements.txt
pytest                  # Added to requirements.txt
```

### Error Handling Improvements
```python
# NLTK download error handling
try:
    nltk.data.find('corpora/stopwords')
except LookupError:  # Changed from DownloadError
    nltk.download('stopwords', quiet=True)

# FAISS bounds checking
if idx < len(self.metadata):
    chunk_data = self.metadata.iloc[idx]
else:
    continue  # Skip invalid indices
```

### Interface Fixes
```python
# Fixed Gradio tuple format error
def respond(question: str, product_filter: str, history: list) -> tuple:
    # Removed conflicting yield statements
    # Fixed chatbot output format
    return response, sources, gr.update(interactive=True), gr.update(interactive=True)
```
